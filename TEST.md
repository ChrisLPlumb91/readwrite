## Structural Integrity & Responsivity Testing
<hr>
For these tests, I observed the behaviour of each page of the website, as well as variations of each page, within fourteen device profiles via Google Chrome's developer tools. The devices tested were as follows:
<ul>
    <li>iPhone SE (SE)</li>
    <li>iPhone XR (XR)</li>
    <li>iPhone 12 Pro (12P)</li>
    <li>Google Pixel 5 (P5)</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy S8+ (S8+)</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra (S20U)</li>
    <li>iPad Air (A)</li>
    <li>iPad Mini (M)</li>
    <li>Microsoft Surface Pro 7 (SP7)</li>
    <li>Microsoft Surface Duo (SD)</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy A51/71 (A51)</li>
    <li>Samsung Galaxy Fold (F)</li>
    <li>Google Nest Hub (NH)</li>
    <li>Google Nest Hub Max (NHM)</li>
</ul>

## Functionality Testing
<hr>
Much of this aspect of the site has already been tested using automated testing procedures that can be found in the app directory (bulletinboard), but manual testing was still necessary to ensure that the site was <em>visibly</em> changing in response to these interactions. The following functionality was tested and found to be working correctly:
<br>
<br>

    <li>Eleventh bulletin added - appears at top of main page once approved, and individual page displays when navigated to - pushes last bulletin on first page to top of second page. (1 test)</li>
<strong>COMMENTS</strong>
    <li>Comment added from bulletin page - appears below bulletin / comment form - main page number of comments for bulletin increases by 1. (1 test)</li>

## Site Navigation Testing
<hr>

This particular testing involved trying every link and URL on the site to ensure that they send the user where they are supposed to. To a certain extent, this has been covered by the automated tests I wrote, but I was unable to test that actual buttons and anchor elements were working properly this way, as I was supplying URLs to said tests, rather than testing DOM elements. The following links were tested and were found to be functioning properly:
<br>
